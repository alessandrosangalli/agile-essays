# Agile Essays

What's the point of saying we're doing agile software development if we don't get the heart of the idea right? For example, reducing risk through continuous deliveries (decreasing the feedback loop).

Do you want something to become fashionable in the industry? start charging for certifications. Have you ever seen any extreme programming certification mafia?

Agile software development is the best risk management system we know. Estimates are a risk for the client, choose continuous delivery and evolutive design.

Abstraction adds complexity, when it solves a problem i'ts ok, but when is just accidental complexity (example: unnecessary interfaces, when a class has just one implementation) we are increasing the cost of the feature (Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development).

Why agile teams realy need to understand agile development? because they have freedom to choose how to work, if they don't understand agile development, they can get in troubles.

If you have slow feedback loop, you can lose trust from your team and you may want work about work (like Scrum dailys).

## Why big teams doesn't work? (not exactly teams but groups of development, you can have a big team but with smalls groups of development)
Agile software development implies connection with product/client. The bigger the team is, the greater the likelihood of only some of the members be conected to the 
value to be delivered. Even if only a few members of a little team will develop a feature, all the team need to understand the value.

Delivery processes of large teams tend to be Taylorist instead of agile. There will usually be something like a backlog (created by some manager) and the members will do the tasks without customer interaction and not even understand how it adds value to the product. This also is bad for continous delivery.

*Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.* (Agile Manifesto)

## Speed
We must assume that the engineer takes exactly as long as he needs to finish a feature.
There are technical or business difficulties that can impact delivery time, but these are obstacles that we cannot avoid.

What causes delay in development are frictions caused by the environment and the organization. These frictions must be observed and eliminated.

**Agile is not a time-driven development method.**

SQUAT = Status Quo Using Agile Terminology

On remote environment, create open rooms to instigate the teamwork

## On Sync Code Review
Author perspective is a illusion, does not make sense. You cannot really expect a third person who's never been involve in any conversation about the work done by the pair, who hasn't participated in the thinking process that led to that code, who hasn't discussed the intricaies of a solution, to be able to jump in at the end of development and give any productive advice. And if any productive advice is given, that's a waste, cause it's happening too late. 

## Joy Of Agility notes
If something is slow, stressful, or awkward, transform it via safety and speed.

What activities are you or your customers forced to perform today that are slow, hard, and ungraceful? What product or service could you invent that would give you or your customers the superpowers to make those same activities quick, easy, and graceful?
Help people be agile by removing the stress and mess of slow, hard, ungraceful experiences.

How often do you or your teams spend time with actual users or customers? What could improve this collaboration?
Bring together people who can identify and solve problems. Close, frequent collaboration increases agility.

Traditions are hard to break. Many people who learned how to perform a skill years or decades ago use the same technique when teaching others. They are stuck in a traditional mindset, unaware of new, innovative approaches that help us establish balance sooner; drive out fear more effectively; and make it quicker, easier, and more graceful to learn a new skill.
Don’t just blindly follow long-established approaches when learning a new skill. Explore alternatives that accelerate learning.

I love to collaborate with others to discover bargains: high value at low cost. Bargain hunting is an opportunity to be agile by considering several approaches to solving a problem and discovering a suitable solution that is both efficient and effective. Are you regularly considering your options?
To be more agile, consider at least three options.

Stop hurrying, find balance, and learn quickness under control. Be quick—but don’t hurry.

A siloed team tends to focus on its own work and doesn’t collaborate gracefully with other siloed teams. When an organization needs work to be done across silos, you end up with slow handoffs—one silo waiting a while for another silo to complete work.

Teams that are truly agile work quickly and easily and have few to no slow handoffs. 

They are composed of the right mix of staff (something we call a “balanced team”) to enable high-speed value creation and delivery. Two of the most agile teams I’ve ever worked with were not small. One team had sixteen full-time people (and several more part-time staff) while the other had thirty full-time people.

•    Remove one slow handoff at a time: Look for one slow handoff and remove it by inviting an external person to collaborate (even temporarily) with your team. Repeat for every slow handoff.
•    Insource slow dependencies: For any slow dependency, find a way to insource it completely rather than outsourcing it to another team.
•    Make the slowness visible: Calculate and visualize the time wasted while waiting for slow handoffs to complete. Use metrics and visualizations to catalyze a change toward a genuine, balanced team.
•    Limit work in process: While a team is waiting on other teams to complete work, it often begins new work. This leads to lots of work in process, with little getting finished and delivered. Limiting the amount of new work that may be started before current work is finished is a way to bring more attention to the bottlenecks resulting from slow handoffs.

Respond rapidly to people. It respects them and rewards you.


## Lack of education
There is a big lack of education in our industry, example:
  "I need estimates because i cant invest 1M without know if it will works in one year"
  R: "If we do something in 2 weeks to you see if is right and we can adjust, go to the next thing and do the more important things first"
  "It will be great!"
