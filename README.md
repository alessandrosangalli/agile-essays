## Why big teams doesn't work?
Agile software development implies connection with product/client. The bigger the team is, the greater the likelihood of only some of the members be conected to the 
value to be delivered. Even if only a few members of a little team will develop a feature, all the team need to understand the value.

Delivery processes of large teams tend to be Taylorist instead of agile. There will usually be something like a backlog (created by some manager) and the members will do the tasks without customer interaction and not even understand how it adds value to the product.
