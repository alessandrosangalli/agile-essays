## Why big teams doesn't work?
Agile software development implies connection with product/client. The bigger the team is, the greater the likelihood of only some of the members be conected to the 
value to be delivered. Even if only a few members of a little team will develop a feature, all the team need to understand the value.

Delivery processes of large teams tend to be Taylorist instead of agile. There will usually be something like a backlog (created by some manager) and the members will do the tasks without customer interaction and not even understand how it adds value to the product. This also is bad for continous delivery.

*Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.* (Agile Manifesto)

## Speed
We must assume that the engineer takes exactly as long as he needs to finish a feature.
There are technical or business difficulties that can impact delivery time, but these are obstacles that we cannot avoid.

What causes delay in development are frictions caused by the environment and the organization. These frictions must be observed and eliminated.
