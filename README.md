# Agile Essays

What's the point of saying we're doing agile software development if we don't get the heart of the idea right? For example, reducing risk through continuous deliveries (decreasing the feedback loop).

Do you want something to become fashionable in the industry? start charging for certifications. Have you ever seen any extreme programming certification mafia?

Agile software development is the best risk management system we know. Estimates are a risk for the client, choose continuous delivery and evolutive design.

## Why big teams doesn't work?
Agile software development implies connection with product/client. The bigger the team is, the greater the likelihood of only some of the members be conected to the 
value to be delivered. Even if only a few members of a little team will develop a feature, all the team need to understand the value.

Delivery processes of large teams tend to be Taylorist instead of agile. There will usually be something like a backlog (created by some manager) and the members will do the tasks without customer interaction and not even understand how it adds value to the product. This also is bad for continous delivery.

*Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer
through early and continuous delivery
of valuable software.* (Agile Manifesto)

## Speed
We must assume that the engineer takes exactly as long as he needs to finish a feature.
There are technical or business difficulties that can impact delivery time, but these are obstacles that we cannot avoid.

What causes delay in development are frictions caused by the environment and the organization. These frictions must be observed and eliminated.

**Agile is not a time-driven development method.**
